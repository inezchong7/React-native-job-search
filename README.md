<h3>Key Differences</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Expo Router: handles navigation (uses file-based routing system)</li>
  <li>Text component (instead of p, h1, h2, h3)</li>
  <li>View component (similar to div, but with added functionality -> creates layout structures for other components; props for appearance and behaviour; uses Flexbox layout by default)</li>
  <li>TouchableOpacity (buttons, links, other interactive elements that fades in opacity when pressed): cousin of React Button component with more room for customisation and flexibility</li>
  <li>ActivityIndicator (shows spinner or loading indicator in app): fully customisable, eg. size, color</li>
  <li>Flatlsit (renders long item list to be scrolled): like React map function but with optimized scroll performance, and item separation (comparison: Flatlist for larger lists with smooth scrolling; Map function for smaller lists)</li>
  <li>ScrollView (holds multiple components and views with scroller): like 'overflow: scroll' in html, enhances user experience</li>
  <li>SafeAreaView (safe zone to render content without being covered by phone's hardware features like home indicator or status bar)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
